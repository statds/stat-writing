# Getting Started

## Full Cycle of a Statistical Research Project
Like any research project, a statistical research project starts with an
interesting idea, and goes through a full cycle of brainstorming, planning with 
the
right design/methods, investigating with the simulation studies/data analyses,
fixing and iterating as necessary, and summarizing through writing/revision.


1. Find a topic of interest. The topic should interest you, and be something 
   which you already know at least somewhat and/or can find out more. The topic 
   should
   also be something that is within your capacity restricted by your skill sets
   and time. Check the literature to see what works are available on it or
   related topics. In short, the topic should be reasonably interesting and
   doable. You can get ideas for research by 
    + attending seminars;
    + reading journals, books, magazines, and newspapers;
    + consulting;
    + collaboration.
  
   A critical factor to consider when identifying a topic is data. You
   could start from an idea and then check if there are data available
   that can be used to test out your idea. Alternatively, you could
   start from some available data and formulate your ideas by closely
   studying the data. The idea-driven approach could be frustrating
   when you don't have data to support it; the data-driven approach
   needs creative thinking to do something new on a old data.

1. Initial planning. After you have identified a topic, you need to narrow down
   on the specific research questions that you want to answer, what data will be
   needed/used, and what methods are appropriate.
    + Form a hypothesis, design a study, conduct the study, make notes.
    + Collect data and/or find some existing data.
    + Decide on appropriate statistical methods.
    + Make a tentative outline to guide writing.
1. Statistical investigation. 
    + Perform data analysis.
    + Summarize substantive findings.
    + Investigate the performance of proposed methods via simulations.
1. Iterate between planning and investigation.
1. Write, revise and proofread. Revising and writing are two separate processes.
    + Start with an outline for each section which includes major headings, 
      sub-headings and paragraphs covering different points.  
    + When starting, the goal is to get the main points and ideas captured in a 
      document, so at this time, it does not matter if sentences are incomplete 
      or if the grammar is incorrect.
    + Are the statistical statements correct?
    + Are the data displays informative?
    + Are the conclusions based on sound evidence?
    + Are the style and tone appropriate for the venue?
    + Is the problem clearly stated?
    + Check organization --- reorganize paragraphs and add transitions where 
      necessary.
    + Work on sentences --- check spelling, punctuation, word choice, tense, etc.
    + Make sure all researched information is documented (reproducibility).
    + Rework introduction and conclusion.
    + Read out loud to check for flow.
    + Find a friend to review.

## Writing a Research Proposal

A research proposal is piece of writing that details exactly what you plan to do
in a research project.


The following components are expected in your proposal.

+ Introduction: Introducing the topic and why you have chosen this topic (3--5
  lines). Mention briefly the current related research and cite relevant works.
+ Specific aims: Formulate a research question or hypothesis in the
  chosen topic. Describe briefly why you select such a question or hypothesis
  and its importance in the field (cite sources).
+ Data description: Describe your data set (for instance: sampling scheme,
  number of observations, number of variables, variables of interest, nature of
  the variables) and the source of your data set if it is not collected by
  yourself.
+ Research design/methods/schedule: 
  Describe briefly (5-7 lines) your plan of action. If you
  choose to apply any specific statistical methods, please mention and cite
  them. Please be consistent here with your research hypothesis. Write a line
  regarding how the methods would help in investigating the research hypothesis.
+ Discussion: What do you expect to find and why
  do you feel so? Any ways your work can corroborate or challenge existing
  results or assumptions? What are the potential impacts of your work? What if
  the results of your investigation is not what you expected?
+ Conclusion: Wrap it up by briefly summarizing your research proposal and
  reinforcing your researchâ€™s stated purpose.
