As with all scientific papers, it should have some commonly expected structures which include components such as title, abstract, keywords, introduction, methods, results, discussion, acknowledgements, references, appendix, and supplement. Due to the specificity of the statistical discipline and application areas, however, statistical papers could look quite different one from another. There are different types of statistical papers. A theory paper would look similar to a paper in mathematics, with statement of the problem, presentation of some theorems, and technical proofs. Such papers are not covered here. We focus on two types of statistical papers: application papers and method papers. Application papers focus on a specific application problem in a certain domain where the research discoveries depend on applications of existing or novel statistical methods. Method papers, on the other hand, aim to provide a general methodological solution to a class of applied problems. Often, methods paper have a theoretical component, for example, the establishment of the asymptotic properties of a new estimator. An applied paper in statistics could be a method paper in the domain of the problem it solves. An author should always keep the target audience in mind when writing. There are many statistical journals on the wide spectrum from applied to theoretical papers. Each one has its own aims and scope, with different target readerships. Writings such as customary statistical reports that are not intended for journal publications also have target readerships. Regardless of the audience, any scientific paper should be convincing and concise. You need to show the readers that your work is important, valid, and useful. You don’t want to waste the time of any readers. 1.1 Applied papers An applied paper has a widely accepted structure: Introduction Data description Methods Results Discussion An applied paper can be applying existing statistical methods to solve an applied problem. See, for example, Price and Yan (2022); D. J. Caplan et al. (2019). When sensitivity analysis is desired for the applications, one can have a section on simulation studies. See, for example, J. Jiao et al. (2022); Li et al. (2021). Some applied papers can involve novel methodology development that is motivated by an applied problem. In such cases, simulation studies become necessary, where you validate your methods with simulated data so you can check your estimator with the truth. Such check is not feasible when analyzing real data. See, for example, Jieying Jiao, Hu, and Yan (2021); Hu et al. (2021). 1.2 Methods papers A methods paper focuses on a novel method that is applicable to a general class of problems arising in different domains. A commonly seen structure is: Introduction Methods (e.g., estimation, hypothesis tests, diagnosis) Properties Simulations Illustrations (with real applications) Discussion/Conclusions. The simulations section is often needed for methods papers. Any method has assumptions. Any reasonably good method should work as expected when the assumptions hold. It would be even better if it remains working when some of the assumptions are violated. Simulation studies can be designed to check whether the proposed estimators are unbiased and more efficient than competing estimators; whether the proposed tests retains their sizes and are more powerful than competing tests. Here are some examples: Li et al. (2023); Lau and Yan (2022). 1.3 Scientific Writing Many resources on scientific writing are available. For example, Gopen and Swan (1990) was selected by its publisher, American Scientist, as one of its 36 “Classic Articles” from the first 100 years of its publishing history. Popular books are Oshima and Hogue (2000), Gopen (2004), Hairston and Keene (2003), and Lebrun and Lebrun (2021).

"],["ch-tools.html", "Chapter 2 Using the Right Tools for Writing 2.1 Git for Version Control 2.2 LaTeX for Typesetting 2.3 Using R Markdown as a Frontend 2.4 Command Line Interface", " Chapter 2 Using the Right Tools for Writing Many people use MS Word when it comes to writing. Not withholding the importance of the invention of MS Office, it is not the right tool to write statistical papers. Writing a statistical paper using MS Word would be as interesting as running a statistical data analysis using MS Excel. Simply put, MS Office is great for office staff to do routine office documentary tasks. For professional writing, one need to be aware of the professional tools and invest time to master them. The right, high-quality, professional typesetting system is LaTeX. LaTeX is a typesetting language that makes it easier and cleaner to write documents involving extensive mathematical content. It is the standard in Statistics, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and other disciplines that require many mathematical formulas. It separates the appearance of a document from its content. This allows authors to be able to focus on writing the content without having to worry about its appearance until the end. There are many different professionally looking appearances one can choose or design, allowing for easy adaptation to different formats and styles. The document has .tex extension, and can be edited by your favorite text editor. The final output of the document can have different formats, the most popular of which is pdf, which stands for portable document format. It can be opened on any platform (computer operating system). The source .tex file is a plain text file. Just like source code of any programming language, a plain text file allows version control, which makes tracking and managing the source easy and professional. The most popular version control tool today is git. 2.1 Git for Version Control Many tutorials are available in different formats. Here is a YouTube video ``Git and GitHub for Beginners — Crash Course’’ The video also covers GitHub, a cloud service for Git. Other similar services are, for example, bitbucket and GitLab. A cloud service gives you a cloud back up of your work and makes collaboration with co-workers easy. There are tools that make learning Git easy. Here is a collection of online Git exersices that I used for Git training in other courses that I taught. Here is a game called Oh My Git, an open source game about learning Git! 2.1.1 Set Up Download Git here. Make a GitHub Account here if you don’t have one yet. Get started with your GitHub account by following the help page. One important step is the set-up. The connection between your local and GitHub repositories needs to be set up only once. One easy way is with a personal access token, as illustrated in a YouTube video. 2.1.2 Most Frequently Used Git Commands git clone: Clones a remote repository to a local folder. Requires either HTTPS link or SSH key to authenticate. git pull: Downloads any updates made to the remote repository and automatically updates the local repository. git status: Returns the state of the working directory. Lists the files that have been modified, and are yet to be or have been staged and/or committed. Shows if the local repository is begind or ahead a remote branch. git add: Adds new or modified files to the Git staging area. Gives the option to select which files are to be sent to the remote repository git rm: Used to remove files from the staging index or the local repository. git commit: Commits changes made to the local repository and saves it like a snapshot. A message is recommended with every commit to keep track of changes made. git push: Pushes commits made on local repository to the remote repository. 2.1.3 Tips on using Git: Use the command line interface instead of the web interface (e.g., upload on GitHub) Make frequent small commits instead of rare large commits. Make commit messages informative and meaningful. Name your files/folders by some reasonable convention. Lower cases are better than upper cases. No blanks in file/folder names. Keep the repo clean by not tracking generated files. Creat a .gitignore file for better output from git status. Keep the linewidth of sources to under 80 for better git diff view. 2.1.4 Pull Request To contribute to an open source project (e.g., our classnotes), use pull requests. Pull requests “let you tell others about changes you’ve pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.” Watch this YouTube video: GitHub pull requests in 100 seconds. 2.2 LaTeX for Typesetting A source file has extension name .tex. It is a plain text file that can be edited by any text editor. It can be tracked easily for differences between any two versions. Different document classes are predefined such as letter, article, report, beamer (for presentations), and book. Customized document classes can be defined once you know more about LaTeX. We focus on article here. The instructions in this section are practiced in a demo repo. Anthony Zeimekakis was an undergraduate student who worked with us on a thesis. The tex sources, data, and code are in a GitHub repo, which can be used as a template too. This paper was published in American Statistician, two years after Anthony graduated. Interested students beaware that this is a serious commitment. 2.2.1 A beginner’s template For the product to look like a paper, we need to have title, author, abstract, sections, and references. Let us start from a very basic template in the demo repo. Clone it to an appropriate location on your own computer. Go to the manuscript folder and compile the pdf product with the following: pdflatex statspaper bibtex statspaper pdflatex statspaper pdflatex statspaper It is the bibtex step that incorporates the references from the bib files. Two rounds of pdflatex are necessary for  to get all the cross-referencing settled. The whole process could be automated by: latexmk -pdf statspaper Advanded users may take a look at the Makefile, in which different targets can be set up and the needed opertations for each target is automated. Tips on getting started with . Read the compiling log and fix the errors/warnings. Googling the error/warning messages usually helps. Limit the preamble to include only what is necessary. Set up document margins with the geometry package. No manually controlling spaces. Familiarize yourself with LaTeX symbol tables. Keep line widths under 80 characters in source files. Separate paragraphs in source files by double blank lines. Define acronyms at their first occurrences and only once. 2.2.2 Math equations For serious math typesetting, use packages amsmath, amsthm, and others. Tips on using math: Punctuate equations as they always are part of sentences. Add spaces between symbols for better readability in sources. Do not start a sentence with a math symbol; rephrase to avoid it. No fractions (\\frac) in inline math expressions. No breaking inline math expressions into different lines in tex sources. No labeling equations that are not referenced. Reference labeled equations with \\eqref instead of (\\ref). Keep fonts consistent for the same notations (e.g., \\(n\\) not n; AIC not \\(AIC\\)). Use appropriate sizes for parentheses. When multiple parentheses are needed in mathematical expressions, use the following ordering unless the journal specifies otherwise \\([\\{(\\mbox{math here})\\}].\\) Use predefined math functions (e.g, \\(\\exp\\) not \\(exp\\); \\(\\Pr\\) not \\(P\\)). Use \\allowdisplaybreak to allow page breaks in aligned equations. Use \\dd for differentiation operator (available from package physics). No breaking long equations arbitrarily in tex source; break them into short lines at appropriate places and add sufficient spaces to make the sources more readable. Align at appropriate places in multiline equations. 2.2.3 Tables If you are manually typing a table source, think if you can generate the source. There are multiple R packages that can generate the tex source from a given dataset. See package xtable for example. Tips on professional tables: Use tbp for floating locations; avoid h. Make it self-contained with an informative caption. Captions should be located above the table unless the journal specifies otherwise. Avoid vertical lines. Put negative signs in math mode. Use better top, middle, and bottom rules from package booktabs. Allow hierarchy by cmidrule(). Do not change font size for tables. Change table layout to fit instead of re-sizing it. Right adjust numbers with decimal places. Use consistent number of decimal places within a column or row of same types of measurements. Avoid having many leading 0’s in decimal entries. See Small Guide to Making Nice Tables by Markus Puschel 2.2.4 Figures Use vector graphs, not raster graphs (unless you have to, e.g., screenshots). Save the code that generates the figures so the figures can be improved easily. Tips on figures: Use tbp for floating locations; avoid h. Use latex package graphicx. Make it self-contained with an informative caption. Captions should be located below the figure unless the journal specifies otherwise. For line plots with different groups, use different line pattern to distinguish them, not only color, so that readers can tell the difference if printed in black/white. Same for different dots (symbols) on plots. Use colorblind friendly colors (especially avoid red/green). Keep the right aspect ratio when necessary (e.g., basketball court; map; pp-plot). Remove extra margins. Keep the ratio when resizing (e.g., width = \\textwidth) Name the figure files appropriately. 2.2.5 References BibTeX is a reference management tool for formatting lists of references that can be used together with to generate a reference list. Non-referenced references are not to be cited. All referenced references are to be listed. This nice feature is made possible by the package natbib. We need to collect references in BibTeX format and save them in a bib database (.bib) file. The display styles of the references are controlled by bib style (.bst) files. Many journals have their own bib style files available for download. One can construct a customized bib style easily with the help of custom-bib. An alternative to BibTeX and natbib is biblatex. Most journals, however, use BibTeX and natbib, so we focus on that here. A reference is cited in the manuscript through its key by \\citep{} for parenthetical citations or \\citet{} for textual citations, where the key is placed inside the curly brackets. The key is used to cite or cross-reference the bibliographic entry in a .tex document. Variations \\citep*{} and \\citet*{} prints all authors. Sometimes, \\citeauthor{} and \\citeyear{} can be useful when only author(s) or year is needed. The key of the cited references is put in the parentheses. For \\citep{}, multiple keys separated by commas can be put in the same parentheses for citing multiple references. Two optional arguments are allowed to \\citep[][]{}. For example, \\citep[see, e.g.,][p. 26]{} could be useful when a specific page (or section/chapter) is being referenced as an example. In general, to compile a tex file with bibtex references into a pdf document, one needs to run pdflatex first, then bibtex, and then pdflatex twice to get the references correct. A simpler solution is latexmk -pdf. In my practice, I always have a Makefile and use make to smartly automate the compiling process. See, for example, Anthony’s thesis repo. Tips on preparing BibTeX databases: Devise a good naming convention for reference keys and stick to it. Keep the bib database sorted and formatted tidy. (No repeated entries.) Title: Capitalize first letters of notional words (not form words). Use Google Scholar to get the bibtex source of a reference, but be sure to quality control the google output for missing fields and errors. Protect capitalization of words with special meanings in curly braces. (e.g., {B}ayesian, {M}arkov Chain {M}onte {C}arlo) Protect capitalization of initial words after a colon in titles and journals. Use title style for jornal/book titles. For book chapters or proceeding articles, use @incollection instead of @article, and fill the booktitle and editor fields. Separate pages numbers with double dashes and no other spaces (e.g., pages = {110--118}). Books need to have publisher and address fields. For preprints, always check if they have been published recently. Use the note field to show information that should always be shown, All references without page numbers or volume number should be checked. Keep bib key style consistent. 2.2.6 Cross-referencing Define a label for each object and refer to it by its label. Tips on cross-referencing: Devise a good naming convention for labels and stick to it. Use different label prefixes for different types of objects (e.g, eq: for equations, sec: for sections, tab: for tables, fig: for figures, alg: for algorithms, etc.) Labels within the source(s) for a single document must be unique. Prevent referencing numbers from starting at a new line (e.g., use Table~\\ref{tab:simulation}; note the tilde). Watch warnings from compiling logs for undefined labels or multiply defined labels and fix them. Use package xr for cross-document referencing (and labels must be unique across documents). 2.3 Using R Markdown as a Frontend Here is a template from the UConn Data Science Lab. 2.4 Command Line Interface On Linux or MacOS, simply open a terminal. On Windows, several options can be considered. Cygwin (with X): https://x.cygwin.com Git Bash: https://www.gitkraken.com/blog/what-is-git-bash The new Windows OS provides a Windows Subsystem for Linux. As the name suggests, it aims to provide a Linux system on a Windows computer. It might be worth trying out. To jump start, here is a tutorial: Ubuntu Linux for beginners. At least, you need to know how to handle files and traverse across directories. The tab completion and introspection supports are very useful. Here are several commonly used shell commands: cd: change directory; .. means parent directory. pwd: present working directory. ls: list the content of a folder; -l long version; -a show hidden files; -t ordered by modification time. mkdir: create a new directory. cp: copy file/folder from a source to a target. mv: move file/folder from a source to a target. rm: remove a file a folder. "],["getting-started.html", "Chapter 3 Getting Started 3.1 Full Cycle of a Statistical Research Project 3.2 Writing a Research Proposal", " Chapter 3 Getting Started 3.1 Full Cycle of a Statistical Research Project Like any research project, a statistical research project starts with an interesting idea, and goes through a full cycle of brainstorming, planning with the right design/methods, investigating with the simulation studies/data analyses, fixing and iterating as necessary, and summarizing through writing/revision. Find a topic of interest. The topic should interest you, and be something which you already know at least somewhat and/or can find out more. The topic should also be something that is within your capacity restricted by your skill sets and time. Check the literature to see what works are available on it or related topics. In short, the topic should be reasonably interesting and doable. You can get ideas for research by attending seminars; reading journals (e.g., Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sprots; American Statistician), books, magazines (e.g., Chance; Significance), and newspapers; consulting; collaboration. A critical factor to consider when identifying a topic is data. Idea-driven approach: You could start from an idea and then check if there are data available that can be used to test out your idea. It could be frustrating when you cannot find data after searching around. data-driven approach: You could start from some available data and formulate your ideas by closely studying the data. This approach needs creative thinking to do something new on a old data. Initial planning. After you have identified a topic, you need to narrow down on the specific research questions that you want to answer, what data will be needed/used, and what methods are appropriate. Form a hypothesis, design a study, conduct the study, make notes. Collect data and/or find some existing data. Decide on appropriate statistical methods. Make a tentative outline to guide writing. Statistical investigation. Perform data analysis. Summarize substantive findings. Investigate the performance of proposed methods via simulations. Iterate between planning and investigation. Write, revise and proofread. Revising and writing are two separate processes. Start with an outline for each section which includes major headings, sub-headings and paragraphs covering different points. When starting, the goal is to get the main points and ideas captured in a document, so at this time, it does not matter if sentences are incomplete or if the grammar is incorrect. Are the statistical statements correct? Are the data displays informative? Are the conclusions based on sound evidence? Are the style and tone appropriate for the venue? Is the problem clearly stated? Check organization — reorganize paragraphs and add transitions where necessary. Work on sentences — check spelling, punctuation, word choice, tense, etc. Make sure all researched information is documented (reproducibility). Rework introduction and conclusion. Read out loud to check for flow. Find a friend to review. There are resource online that could be helpful. Here are some examples. UCSD: Data Science: Guide for Independent Projects FreeCodeCamp: How to build a data science project from scratch 3.2 Writing a Research Proposal A research proposal is piece of writing that details exactly what you plan to do in a research project. The following components are expected in your proposal. Introduction: Introducing the topic and why you have chosen this topic (3–5 lines). Mention briefly the current related research and cite relevant works. Why shold we care? What have been done? What are new? Specific aims: Formulate a research question or hypothesis in the chosen topic. Describe briefly why you select such a question or hypothesis and its importance in the field (cite sources). Why is it hard/interesting/unstudied? How hard/interesting is it? Data description: Describe your data set (for instance: sampling scheme, number of observations, number of variables, variables of interest, nature of the variables) and the source of your data set if it is not collected by yourself. Research design/methods/schedule: Describe briefly (5-7 lines) your plan of action. Why are the methods appropriate (with proper references) for the problem? What steps are required to use the methods? Which of the steps will be particularly hard? What would you do if the hardest steps do not work as planned? How would the methods help in investigating the task problem? Discussion: potential problems and solutions. What do you expect to find and why do you feel so? Any ways your work can corroborate or challenge existing results or assumptions? What are the potential impacts of your work? What if the results of your investigation is not what you expected? Conclusion (optional): Wrap it up by briefly summarizing your research proposal and reinforcing your research’s stated purpose.

Hairston and Keene (2003) suggest that the title of a research paper should accomplish four goals: predict the content of the research paper; be interesting to the reader; reflect the tone of the writing; contain important keywords (that makes it easier to be found from keywords search). The title of a paper is usually determined when the paper is close to completion. To come up with a good title, list some key phrases that you would like to have, and be creative in forming a good title that consists of most of them. Here are some tips. Be informative by including these aspects: topic, method(s), data, and results. Consider adding a subtitle to give more specifics about the paper. Use appropriate critical keywords to increase the discoverability of the paper. Follow the requirements from the instructions or journals. Keep it as concise as possible. 4.2 Abstract Marron (1999) recommended the following: Abstract material needs to be carefully chosen. A balance between the twin goals of brevity and maximal information content should again be carefully sought. There is room for more detail than in the title, but not enough room for all ideas covered in the paper. Make sure each “high point” is included. The paper will have a better chance in the review process if it is made clear what is done, and why it is important, since this will immediately capture the interest of the reviewer. Any recommendations for length here must be more case dependent. Longer papers will usually need longer abstracts. However, something between 4 and 10 sentences is reasonable for most situations. Mathematical notation is rarely useful in the abstract. Sometimes notation is introduced in an abstract, and then not used at all! Even when notation is used in the abstract, the point can usually be conveyed more efficiently in words alone. Tips: Open with a sentence to establish the importance of the subject of the paper. Identify a gap in the literature to set up the background of the paper. Highlight the novelty/contributions of the paper. For application papers, allude to new discoveries and their impacts. For method papers, outline the essence of the methodology, and evidence from theoretical and numerical studies supporting the methods. It must make sense when read in isolation for those who only read the abstract, and must also provide a clear and accurate summary of the manuscript for readers who read the entire manuscript (Zeiger 2000). Should not include citations. 4.3 Keywords Keywords are words in addition to those in the title that attract search queries. Including the most relevant keywords helps other researchers find your paper. No need to repeat anything in the title already. List them in alphabetical order. Contain words and phrases that suggest what the topic is about. 4.4 Introduction The introduction section is always the first section of a paper. Some journals may not call it introduction but require a section that serves the same purpose. The purpose of the introduction is to stimulate the reader’s interest and to provide background information which is pertinent to the study (Jenkins 1995). The introduction section guides the readers from a general subject area to the narrow topic of the paper. It should answer three questions: Why does it matter? What has already been done? What is new? That is, the introduction sections need to explain the importance of the topic of the paper, provide the background of the research work, and highlight the contributions of the work. At the end of the introduction, a roadmap, or an outline of the paper is useful in helping the readers navigate through the following sections. The introduction is typically outlined at the very beginning of the writing process, but completed towards the end after the other sections have been written. Do NOT wait to perform the literature review until last, however! This should happen before the research is undertaken to ensure you are not duplicating something that has already been done! An introduction often contains the following items. An overview of the topic. Start with a general overview of your topic and narrow it to the specific subject you are addressing. Then, mention questions or concerns you have about the case. Explain why they are important and why it needs to be addressed right now. Existing works. The introduction is the place to review other conclusions on your topic. The literature review should be thorough, including both old and recent works. It should show that you are aware of prior research. It also introduces past findings to those who might not have that expertise. A gap needs to be identified from the importance of the topic and the current status of the literature, which is the rationale for your work. Why are existing methods not sufficient? What are elements of an attractive solution? Contributions. This is a thesis statement, which summarizes the the contributions of your work to the existing literature, and answers the “what is new” question. A roadmap. A brief summary of what each section does in the paper. This concludes the introduction. 4.5 Data The data section should provide all the details that are relevant for the research project. Who collected the data (source)? How was the data collected? Sampling frame? Sampling approach? What period or range does the data cover? Why does the data help answer the research question? What exploratory analyses are done (descriptives, visualization, etc.)? 4.6 Methods Notation is much easier to digest if the reader first understands the main idea at an intuitive level. Establish notation. What are the observed data? What are the models? What are the parameters to be estimated? How are the point estimators obtained? How are the uncertainty (standard errors) of the point estimators assessed? How are the variances of the point estimators estimated? How are the null distribution of the testing statistics established? Clearly state the assumptions and claims of theoretical results. 4.7 Simulation ADEMP (Morris, White, and Crowther 2019): Aims Data generating mechanism Estimand/target of analysis Methods Performance measures Coding and Execution Analysis/Discussion: with tables and figures. May be included in a Results section. For each table/figure, write down the bullet points to convey to the readers. Group the bullet points in blocks and put the blocks in a logical order. Within each block, put the bullet points in the right logical order. Some (shorter) blocks can be converted into proper paragraphs in the final paper, while other (longer) blocks may remain in bullet form. 4.8 Application Report the statistical analyses in tables/figures. When summarizing from tables/figures, paint the big picture, rather than reiterating all of the little details. Discussions to link the analyses back to the substantive topic (Miller 2015): Having presented the individual pieces of evidence, an investigator must summarize how that evidence, taken together, support the conclusoin of the investigation. Statisticians should explain how the statistical evidence answers the question posed at the beginning of the paper, following standard expository writing guidelines to writing an analytic essay. 4.9 Discussion and Conclusion A summary, again, of the contributions of the research. The research question posed as the `need’ of the introduction must be answered here (Zeiger 2000). Limitations of the current study Future directions. 4.10 Appendix Technical details (e.g., proofs, algorithms) that would otherwise break the flow of the main text. Data source details. 4.11 Acknowledgements This section is optional, but could be used to acknowledge certain individuals who have contributed to the research and/or success of the manuscript (e.g. peer reviewers). In general, if the research upon which you are writing was funded, the funding agency and funding mechanism are typically included here unless otherwise specified. 4.12 References Every reference cited in the paper should appear here. References not cited should not appear here. All are automatically taken care of by BibTeX. Styles are controlled by bib style (.bst file). 4.13 Online Supplement Computer code Data Additional simulation results 4.14 General Tips From Jenkins (1995): In order to maintain continuity between the key sections (introduction, methods, results and discussion) it is helpful to consider the manuscript as telling a story. The strong parts to the story-line are the introduction and the discussion, so the link between these sections must be clear. Devices such as paragraphing, headings, indentation, and enumeration help the reader see the major points that you want to make. As a rule of thumb, if you type a full page (double spaced) without indenting for a new paragraph, you almost certainly have run one thought into another and have missed an opportunity to differentiate your ideas. Any tables and figures included in the manuscript must be mentioned (referenced) within the main text. If journal/instructions do not specify otherwise, tables and figures should be placed near (ideally after) the related text, and on the top of the page. Use consistent notation throughout the manuscript, avoid defining any unnecessary notation, and avoid using the same notation to describe different things (variables, indices, etc.). 4.15 General Tips: Use of English It is relatively easy to read and understand English which is well written. As the quality of writing deteriorates, however, it becomes progressively more difficult for the reader to understand the author’s intended meaning. An obvious problem occurs when the author fails to use properly constructed sentences. This can be easily corrected with revision and external review. A much more dangerous problem occurs when the author unconsciously assumes that the reader is able to follow his/her unwritten train of thought. This can also usually be caught with external review. More tips on the use of English: Use of tenses: Use present tense for most of the manuscript; use past tense only when describing events that occurred in the past (data collection, an experiment that has already been conducted, how simulations were designed). Be consistent with tense usage within sections, paragraphs, etc. Do not use the word ‘significant’ other than in a statistical sense. The word ‘data’ is often mistakenly treated as if it were a singular noun instead of as a plural noun. The word ‘data’ is, in fact, a plural noun (its singular form is ‘datum’).

"],["review-a-paper.html", "Chapter 5 Review a Paper", " Chapter 5 Review a Paper Peer review is the system used to assess the quality of a manuscript before it is published in a journal. Independent researchers in the relevant research area assess submitted manuscripts for originality, validity and significance to help editors determine whether a manuscript should be published in their journal. Reviewing is the other side of the same coin as writing. It is an important skill and service for the scientific community. A good writer anticipates comments from possible reviewers and addresses them in writing. A critical review helps make a manuscript much stronger. According to https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/peer-review-process, Peer review is an integral part of scientific publishing that confirms the validity of the manuscript. Peer reviewers are experts who volunteer their time to help improve the manuscripts they review. By undergoing peer review, manuscripts should become: More robust - peer reviewers may point out gaps in a paper that require more explanation or additional experiments. Easier to read - if parts of your paper are difficult to understand, reviewers can suggest changes. More useful - peer reviewers also consider the importance of your paper to others in your field. In this writing course, we are writing statistical projects. Here is a check list adapted from https://www.science.org/content/article/how-review-paper. Are the background literature and study rationale clearly articulated? Do the hypotheses follow logically from previous work? Are the statistical methods appropriate? Are the methods robust and well controlled? Is the statistical notation clearly defined? Were the statistical methods conducted correctly? Are the assumptions of the statistical methods clearly articulated? Are the assumptions of the statistical methods satisfied? Is the presentation of results clear and accessible? To what extent does the Discussion place the findings in a wider context and achieve a balance between interpretation and useful speculation versus tedious waffling? To write a reviewer’s report, here is a template. A summary of the what the paper is about and how you feel about its solidity. List the major concerns in detail about the paper eluded in the summary. Go through the specific points that are not clearly presented or need to be improved, in the order they appeared in the paper. Finally, a list of really minor stuff (misprints, notation abuse, etc.). Tips: Precisely identify the location of the concern (page number, line number, section number, etc.) Be as constructive as possible. Avoid rude or disparaging remarks. Back up major criticisms. Make the review useful for the editor as well as for the authors. "],["response-to-reviewers.html", "Chapter 6 Response to Reviewers", " Chapter 6 Response to Reviewers Peer-reviewed journals also give the author the opportunity to respond to the reviewer’s comments. This ‘response to reviewers’ document is submitted alongside your manuscript, summarizing the changes that you made in response to the critiques. Follow these rules for writing responses to reviewers, adapted from Noble (1995): Rule 1: Provide an overview, then quote the full set of reviews Begin the response letter with a broad-level summary of the changes, pointing out new broad-level content added in response to the most essential criticisms of the reviewers. Thereafter, the response letter should contain the complete set of reviewer comments with your responses interleaved. Rule 2: Be polite and respectful of reviewers Even if you are convinced that the reviewer lacks intellectual capacity, it is certainly not in your interest to convey this impression to the reviewer. Keep in mind that if the reviewer failed to understand something, the fault likely lies, at least in part, with you for not making the point clear enough. Your goal is to make the work clear and accessible to all readers, not just to experts. Rule 3: Accept the blame If the reviewer failed to understand something, apologize for not making it clear. Even if you are convinced that the text is already clear (i.e., the reviewer simply missed it), consider revising the text and quoting the revised text in your response. In general, even if the requested change seems unnecessary, it is usually better to go ahead and revise with the goal of showing the reviewer that they were listened to and understood. Rule 4: Make the response self-contained When you make changes to the text or to figures, quote the changes directly in the response. If possible, refer to the specific pages/sections/paragraphs were the change was made. Rule 5: Respond to every point raised by the reviewer Even if you do not agree with a comment from a reviewer, you cannot ignore it and must respond to it. If you disagree, provide evidence supporting your claim. Rule 6: Use typography to help the reviewer navigate your response Use changes of typeface, color, and indenting to discriminate between 3 different elements: the review itself, your responses to the review, and changes that you have made to the manuscript. You can explain these typographical conventions in the introduction to your response.

Practice the tips on Git in the notes. By going through the following tasks, ensure your repo has at least 10 commits, each with an informative message. Regularly check the status of your repo using git status. The specific tasks are: Clone the repo to an appropriate folder on your computer. On your computer, add a file called learningGit.md to your repo; use Markdown syntax to fill it with the text of the documentation on Git/GitHub resources. Play with git commit (save): add some a new section Personal Notes to describe your own learning experience. Experiment with commits such as: add new lines; introduce some typos; correct the typo; etc. Make sure you have informative commit messages. Use git diff to view the difference between two commits and appreciate the linewidth recommendation. “Push” your changes to GitHub. Make a change to your file on GitHub and commit. “Pull” the changes to your local computer. Create a “branch” (version), make a change, commit the change. Open a “pull request” (propose changes to the main branch) “Merge” your branch to the main branch. Git will keep track of all your changes. Use the command line to do the exercises.
